"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was born and I 
will give you a complete account of the system, and 
expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
 rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure it
 self, becaus
 e it is pleasure, but because those wh
 o do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
 consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
 anyone who loves or pursues or desires t
 o obtain nice of itself, because it is nice, but because 
 occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and nice can 
 procure him some great pleasure. To take
a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious phys
ical exercise, except to
 obtain someadvantage from it? But who has any righ
at has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pa
in that produces no resultant pleasure?"
